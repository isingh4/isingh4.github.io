											<h6>SKIN CANCER ANALYSIS</h6>
										</header>
										
										<p>AN EVERYDAY ROUTINE SHOULD CONSIST OF YOURSELF TAKING GOOD CARE OF YOUR SKIN. WHEN YOUR SKIN IS NOT GIVEN PROPER CARE, IT COULD RESULT IN SKIN CANCER. OF COURSE, THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY. MY DAY REVOLVES AROUND SKINCARE AND DATA SCIENCE. SINCE ALWAYS I HAVE FOUND INTEREST IN SKINCARE AND KNOWING MORE ABOUT WHAT IMPORTANT FEATURES CAN HELP REDUCE SKIN CANCER. READING MORE ABOUT THE PREVENTIONS GAVE ME A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO ALWAYS CARE ABOUT THE SKIN. DURING MY FREE TIME, I ENJOY EXPERIMENTING AND CREATING HOMEMADE MASKS, USING NATURAL INGREDIENTS. FURTHERMORE, I WANTED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE OTHER ASSOCIATIONS THAT CAN INCREASE THE CHANCES OF HAVING SKIN CANCER. I HAVE DECIDED TO DO THIS RESEARCH PROJECT AS I WOULD LIKE TO COMBINE MY PASSION, SKINCARE, WITH DATA, TO ANALYZE AND DISCUSS THE  THE CORRELATION ON WHY AND HOW SKIN CANCER OCCURS.</p>
